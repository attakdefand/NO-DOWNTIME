# Security Layer Implementation

This document outlines the security features and implementation strategies for the No-Downtime Service, following security best practices for zero-downtime deployments.

## Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of security controls throughout the application stack:

- Continuous validation
- Micro-segmentation

### 3. Security by Design
- Security considerations in every feature
- Secure coding practices
- Regular security assessments
- Automated security testing

## Current Security Implementation
