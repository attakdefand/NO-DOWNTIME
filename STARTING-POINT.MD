## Security Implementation

### Security Principles

#### 1. Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of security controls throughout the application stack:
- Network security
- Transport security
- Application security
- Data security
- Identity and access management

#### 2. Zero Trust Architecture
- Never trust, always verify
- Least privilege access
- Continuous validation
- Micro-segmentation

#### 3. Security by Design
- Security considerations in every feature
- Secure coding practices
- Regular security assessments
- Automated security testing
