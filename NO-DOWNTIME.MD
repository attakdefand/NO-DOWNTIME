Awesome question. “No downtime” is a stack of habits, patterns, and guardrails—not one silver bullet. Here’s a compact, copy-pasteable blueprint you can apply to any stack (I’ll mention Rust/K8s/NATS/Postgres/Redis since that’s your vibe).

# The big idea (3 rules)

1. **Eliminate single points of failure** (redundancy + fast failover).
2. **Reduce blast radius** (isolate, rate-limit, backpressure).
3. **Detect & heal fast** (health probes, SLOs, autoscale, rollbacks).

# Main types → sub-types (with “what good looks like”)

| Main Type                           | Sub-Types (features)                                                                                                                               | What “good” looks like                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **A. Load Distribution & Entry**    | Anycast + multi-region DNS; health-checked DNS; L4/L7 load balancers (Envoy/HAProxy/Nginx); sticky vs stateless sessions; WAF/geo rules            | 2+ LB instances per region; DNS health checks with low TTL; L7 canary routing; sessionless or cookie-affinity only as fallback |
| **B. Health Probes & Self-Healing** | liveness/readiness/startup probes; dependency-aware readiness; graceful shutdown; watchdogs (systemd/K8s restartPolicy); container **healthcheck** | All services implement `/ready` (fast), `/live` (cheap), `/start` (slow); SIGTERM drains; zero 5xx during rollout              |
| **C. Autoscaling & Capacity**       | HPA on CPU/RAM/RPS/queue length; VPA for memory; predictive/cron scaling (peaks); surge capacity (over-provision %); bin-packing and PDBs          | P95 CPU <70%; HPA reacts <60s; can absorb 2× daily peak without SLO breach; PodDisruptionBudget prevents brownouts             |
| **D. Resilience at the Edge**       | request timeouts; retries with jitter + caps; circuit breakers (half-open); bulkheads; rate limits; backpressure (429/503 + Retry-After)           | No retry storms; upstream-aware budgets; user-visible errors are fast & friendly not timeouts                                  |
| **E. Statelessness & Session Mgmt** | stateless handlers; external session store (Redis); idempotency keys; sticky disabled where possible                                               | Safe to kill any pod at any time; multi-LB works without affinity                                                              |
| **F. Data Layer Continuity**        | DB HA (primary/replica/failover); synchronous vs async replication; read replicas; connection pooling; online schema change; backup/restore drills | RPO≤1min, RTO≤5min; pgbouncer or R2D2; strong migration playbooks (gh-ost/pt-osc/zero-downtime SQL)                            |
| **G. Caching & Performance**        | CDN; edge caching; local in-proc cache with TTL; Redis/Memcached; cache stampede protection; slow query budgets                                    | 80–95% cache hit for static; backends protected from thundering herds; slowest queries profiled & fixed                        |
| **H. Queues & Async**               | durable queues (NATS/JetStream/Kafka/SQS); DLQ + backoff; outbox pattern; sagas; consumer autoscaling                                              | Traffic spikes decouple from DB; DLQ alert <1 min; replay is safe/idempotent                                                   |
| **I. Delivery & Deployments**       | blue-green/canary; progressive delivery; surge + maxUnavailable; instant rollback; feature flags; config/version pinning                           | <1% traffic on canary first; automatic rollback on SLO regression; flag kills are safer than deploys                           |
| **J. Observability & Ops**          | RED/USE metrics; tracing; log budgets; SLO/SLI + error budgets; on-call runbooks; incident comms; synthetic probes                                 | P50/95/99 latency + error rate on one board; alerts are SLO-based; weekly error-budget reviews                                 |
| **K. Platform & Hardening**         | resource limits/requests; cgroups/PSI; thread-pool sizing; kernel & TCP tuning; TLS cert auto-renew; secrets/rotation                              | No noisy-neighbor stalls; certs rotate automatically; keep-alive & backlog tuned for peak                                      |
| **L. Disaster Recovery & Chaos**    | region pairs; backups tested; infra as code; game days; chaos experiments (pod kill, DNS cut, DB failover)                                         | Restore drill quarterly; prove RTO/RPO; periodic chaos reveals regressions early                                               |

### Rust/K8s quick mapping

* **Rust server**: Axum/Actix + Tower layers (timeouts, limit, retry, CB), graceful shutdown, `tracing`, idempotency keys.
* **K8s**: `readinessProbe`, `livenessProbe`, `preStop` hook, HPA, PodDisruptionBudget, PodAntiAffinity, RollingUpdate with surge, `topologySpreadConstraints`.
* **Edge**: Envoy/Nginx for canary & retries; Cloud CDN; geo-DNS (Route53/Cloudflare).
* **Data**: Postgres HA (Patroni/CloudSQL/Aurora), pgbouncer; Redis cluster; online migrations.
* **Async**: NATS JetStream/Kafka + DLQ + backoff; outbox.
* **Ops**: Prometheus + Loki + Tempo/Grafana; SLO dashboards; Alertmanager; uptime robot/synthetic checks.

# “Complete features” checklist (minimum viable anti-downtime)

1. Two LBs per region with health-checked DNS.
2. `/ready` and `/live` in every service; SIGTERM drain + graceful shutdown.
3. Timeouts everywhere (edge & service).
4. Retry **only** idempotent ops with jitter + caps; add circuit breakers.
5. Rate limit + backpressure (429/503 + Retry-After).
6. HPA on RPS/CPU + queue length; PDBs + anti-affinity.
7. Stateless handlers; sessions in Redis; idempotency keys.
8. Postgres HA (auto-failover) + pgbouncer; tested backups & PITR.
9. Online schema changes; backward-compatible deploys.
10. Canary + progressive delivery; one-click rollback; feature flags.
11. CDN for static; cache busting; stampede protection.
12. Durable queues + DLQ + replay; consumer autoscaling.
13. SLOs (e.g., **99.9% uptime, P95 < 200 ms**, err rate < 0.1%); RED/USE boards.
14. Synthetic probes from 3+ regions; alert on SLO, not raw CPU.
15. Incident runbooks + error-budget policy; postmortems.
16. Kernel/TCP tuning, connection pooling, resource limits/requests.
17. Cert auto-renew (ACME); secret rotation.
18. Multi-AZ placement; topology spread; chaos kill tests.
19. Infra as code; repeatable DR restore drills.
20. Security controls that also protect availability: WAF, Bot mgmt, abuse throttles.

# Zero-downtime deployment playbook (fast)

1. **Pre-checks**: schema is backward-compatible; feature flags default-off.
2. **Rollout**: send 1% traffic to canary; watch P95 latency/error/SLO for 5–10 min.
3. **Surge rolling**: `maxSurge=25%`, `maxUnavailable=0`.
4. **Observe**: compare canary vs baseline (server + DB).
5. **Flip flags** gradually; keep instant rollback path.
6. **Post-checks**: error budget unchanged; cache invalidation success; DB load steady.

# Failure modes you must test (chaos shortlist)

* Kill any pod: requests still succeed (readiness saved you).
* Drop DB primary: failover ≤ 60s, app recovers automatically.
* Slow upstream (3–5s): timeouts + circuit breakers prevent thread exhaustion.
* DNS outage or 502 at edge: multi-LB + health-checked DNS keeps traffic flowing.
* Thundering herd: cache stampede protection works; queue absorbs burst.

# Simple acceptance targets (tune to your context)

* **Uptime**: 99.9% monthly (≤ 43.2 min downtime).
* **Latency**: P95 < 200 ms for key endpoints.
* **Error rate**: < 0.1% 5xx during steady state; < 0.3% during deploys.
* **Failover**: DB RTO ≤ 5 min, RPO ≤ 1 min.
* **Rollback**: ≤ 2 minutes end-to-end.

If you want, I can turn this into a **lintable checklist** or a **K8s/Tower-layer snippet pack** for Axum (timeouts/retries/circuit-breaker/rate-limit/graceful shutdown) so you can drop it straight into your services.
